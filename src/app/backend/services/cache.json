squad-based shooter that sees the elite forces of the Helldivers battling to win an intergalactic struggle to rid the galaxy of the rising alien threats. From a 3rd person perspective, players use a variety of weapons (pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers) and stratagems (turrets, airstrikes, etc.) to shoot and kill the alien threats. Players can also aim down the sights for a more accurate 1st person camera view. Combat is accompanied by frequent sprays of blood and dismemberment as players exterminate the alien forces or players and squad mates are hit by environmental explosions or friendly fire. Enemy encampments and battlefield environments depict bloodstains and dismembered corpses."}, "ratings": {"esrb": {"rating": "m", "use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "17", "descriptors": "Blood and Gore\r\nIntense Violence", "interactive_elements": "In-Game Purchases\r\nUsers Interact"}, "usk": {"use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "16", "rating": "16", "descriptors": "Gewalt\r\nChats, In-Game-K\u00e4ufe"}, "oflc": {"rating": "ma15", "use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "15", "descriptors": "Strong science fiction violence\r\nOnline interactivity and chat \r\nIn-game purchases"}, "nzoflc": {"rating": "r16", "use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "16", "descriptors": "Bloody Violence"}, "cero": {"rating": "z", "use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "18", "descriptors": "\u72af\u7f6a\u3001\u66b4\u529b"}, "fpb": {"use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "18", "rating": "18", "descriptors": "CI \u2013 Competitive Intensity, H \u2013 Horror, V - Violence"}, "csrr": {"use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "18", "rating": "R", "descriptors": "Violence"}, "crl": {"use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "18", "rating": "18"}, "mda": {"use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "18", "rating": "M18"}, "dejus": {"rating": "18", "descriptors": "Viol\u00eancia Extrema\r\nCompras online\r\nIntera\u00e7\u00e3o de usu\u00e1rios", "use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "18"}, "pegi": {"rating": "18", "descriptors": "Violence\r\nIn-Game Purchases", "required_age": "18", "use_age_gate": "true"}, "kgrb": {"rating": "18", "descriptors": "\ud3ed\ub825", "use_age_gate": "true", "required_age": "18"}, "steam_germany": {"rating_generated": "1", "rating": "18", "required_age": "18", "banned": "0", "use_age_gate": "0", "descriptors": "Drastische Gewalt"}}}, "1086940": {"type": "game", "name": "Baldur's Gate 3", "steam_appid": 1086940, "required_age": "17", "is_free": false, "controller_support": "full", "dlc": [2378500, 2956320], "detailed_description": "<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Final_Keyart_BG3.gif?t=1725654125\" /><br><br>Gather your party and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power.<br><br>Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain.
